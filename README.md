# Mushroom Classification with Machine Learning

This project explores the use of machine learning techniques to classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous based on their physical characteristics.
Dependencies
  This project requires the following Python libraries:

    •	numpy

    •	pandas

    •	seaborn

    •	matplotlib.pyplot

    •	warnings

    •	scikit-learn (specifically linear_model, tree, svm, neighbors, naive_bayes, ensemble, decomposition, metrics)

# Data Acquisition

  1.	Download the UCI Machine Learning Repository's Agaricus mushroom dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/mushroom-classification).
   
  2.	Place the downloaded dataset ( its a CSV file) in the same directory as this project.

# Data Exploration and Pre-processing

  1.	Import necessary libraries.
  
  2.	Load the mushroom dataset using pandas.read_csv().
	
  3.	Explore basic information about the data using df.info (), df.describe(), and visualization techniques:
	
  4.	Check for missing values using df.isnull().sum().

  5.	Visualize the distribution of the target variable (class) using sns.countplot.

  6.	Understand the feature space by creating histograms, scatter plots, and other visualizations.

  7.	Address missing values using appropriate techniques like imputation or removal (depending on data context and feature importance).
	
  8.	Encode categorical features into numerical representations:

  9.	Use techniques like label encoding or one-hot encoding to transform categorical values into numerical features suitable for machine learning algorithms.
  
  10.	Visualize the relationship between features using heatmaps with seaborn.heatmap().
# Model Training and Evaluation

 # 1.	Split Data
   o	Divide the dataset into training and testing sets using sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split. This ensures the model is evaluated on unseen data.
# 2.	Dimensionality Reduction (Optional)
   o	Explore dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) from sklearn.decomposition to potentially improve model performance, especially for high-dimensional datasets.
# 3.	Model Selection and Training
    o	Train various machine learning models commonly used for classification tasks:
    	Logistic Regression from sklearn.linear_model

    	Decision Tree from sklearn.tree

    	Support Vector Machine (SVM) from sklearn.svm

    	K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) from sklearn.neighbors

    	Naive Bayes from sklearn.naive_bayes

    	Random Forest from sklearn.ensemble

    o	Train each model using the training data.

# 4.	Model Evaluation
    o	Evaluate the performance of each model on the testing set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score from sklearn.metrics.

    o	Visualize the performance using techniques like classification reports and confusion matrices.
# 5.	Comparison and Selection
    o	Compare the performance of different models based on the chosen evaluation metrics.
    o	Select the model that achieves the best performance on the testing set.
# Visualization and Interpretation
  1.	Create visualizations (ROC curves) to compare the performance of different models using sklearn.metrics.roc_curve and sklearn.metrics.auc.
  2.	Interpret the results, providing insights into the most important features for classification based on feature importance scores from the chosen model.
